Steven was working on his computer science project, and there were only 2 hours left till it was due. All of the power went out in his apartment. He quickly ranoutside to find another computer to work on.
When he gets to the computer lab, the seats are all occcupied, so he decided to have a scoop of ice cream to calm his mind down.
While eating the ice cream, he saw his best friend, Curtis who has just returned from France. So, they started talking for hours about the intersting experience Curtis had in France.
After calming down, he looked back at the assignment. He realized that he had the due date wrong and he actually had another week to complete it. Relieved, he spent the rest of the day with his friend and handed the assignment on time the next day.
